					<h2>What to do if you have COVID 19 symptoms?</h2>

					   <p>As discussed in the clip above, coronavirus symptoms are classified as a
						    continuous cough, high temperature or a change in sense of taste or smell.
						    Government guidelines now state that an individual must self-isolate immediately,
					      if you or somone you live with has these symptoms. Furthermore, if you do have symptoms
				        the UK Government advises you to get a test within the first 8 days of your first symptoms. </p>

					<h2>What is Self-Isolation?</h2>

					   <p>Self-Isolation requires an individual to not leave their household to help prevent the
						    potential spread of the virus.  The length of a self-isolation is dependant on individual circumstances.
						    However, if you have tested positive for Covid-19 or have symptoms you will generally have to self-isolate for a
						    period of 10 days, at least. Furthermore, any people in your shared household will also need to self-isolate.</p>
